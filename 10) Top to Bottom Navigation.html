        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a fundamental language used in web development to structure and present content on the internet. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, HTML serves as the backbone of web pages, defining the structure and layout of documents. It utilizes a markup system where elements are enclosed in tags to denote various parts of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
        HTML documents consist of a hierarchical structure organized in a tree-like fashion. The latest version, HTML5, introduced in 2014, brought new semantic elements, multimedia integration, and improved support for mobile devices. HTML works in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and interactivity of web pages.
        Key HTML elements include headings (h1 to h6), paragraphs (p), lists (ul, ol, li), links (a), images (img), and more. Tags are paired, opening and closing to enclose content appropriately. HTML's versatility allows developers to create accessible, well-organized, and visually appealing websites. As the foundation of the World Wide Web, HTML continues to evolve, ensuring the creation of dynamic and responsive web experiences across a diverse range of devices and platforms.
